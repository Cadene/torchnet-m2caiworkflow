	abstract = {In this technical report we present our collected dataset of laparoscopic
	cholecystectomies (LapChole). Laparoscopic videos of a total of 20 surgeries
	were recorded and annotated with surgical phase labels, of which 15 were
	randomly pre-determined as training data, while the remaining 5 videos are
	selected as test data. This dataset was later included as part of the M2CAI
	2016 workflow detection challenge during MICCAI 2016 in Athens.},
