\textbf{Goal:} Surgical video frames classification
 
$\triangleright$ Videos of size 1920x1080 Shot at 25 frames per second at IRCAD research center in Strasbourg, France

$\triangleright$ 27 training videos

$\triangleright$ 15 testing videos

$\triangleright$ 8 classes

{\em OK for centered object} & {\em KO for ``natural'' image}
\end{tabular}

\vspace{1mm}

$\triangleright$ Online prediction: $P(y | x_i, x_{i-1}, x_{i-2}, ...)$
 
%$\triangleright$ Supervision: full annotations ({\em e.g.} BB) expensive

$\triangleright$ Usefull to
%Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework 

~~ $\triangleright$ Monitor surgeons

~~ $\triangleright$ Trigger automatic actions

%$\triangleright$ End-to-end training 

\vspace{2mm}
\textbf{Our approach (usable in production)}

$\triangleright$ Firstly, we train a classifier using Deep Learning

$\triangleright$ Secondly, we smooth its predictions 

~~ $\triangleright$ Averaging predictions over last 15 frames

~~ $\triangleright$ Then, we use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a "denoizer"

\textbf{Creating validation set by random split:}

$\triangleright$ Training set: 22 videos
$\triangleright$ Validation set: 5 videos $\{2,9,10,13,27\}$

\textbf{Extracting one frame every 25 frames (1 f/s):}

$\triangleright$ Training set: 59,493 images

$\triangleright$ Validation set: 8,062 images

$\triangleright$ Testing set: 28,732 images

\vspace{-2mm}


\textbf{3 approaches using Deep Learning:}

$\triangleright$ Training CNN From Scratch

~~ $\triangleright$ Good: learning representations for this task

~~ $\triangleright$ Bad: maybe not enough data + lot of hyperparameters

$\triangleright$ Pre-trained CNN as Features Extractor + SVM

~~ $\triangleright$ Good: using (good) representations learned on ImageNet 

~~ $\triangleright$ Bad: large semantic gab between ImageNet and this task

$\triangleright$ Fine Tuning a pre-trained CNN 

~~ $\triangleright$ Good: adapting the representations learned on ImageNet for this task
